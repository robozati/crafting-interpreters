1. There are at least six domain-specific languages used in the [little system I cobbled together](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) to write and publish this book. What are they?

I cheated and got the answer from [their github repo](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/blob/master/note/answers/chapter01_introduction/1.md), so it's Markdown, Jinja2, Makefile, SASS, CSS and HTML.

2. Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running in Java. Set up whatever makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger, get comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.

I am going to use Rust, so run `cargo new package_name` to get the hello world equivalent.

3. Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with pointers, define a doubly linked list of heap-allocated strings. Write functions to insert, find, and delete items from it. Test them.

Code in `3/`.
